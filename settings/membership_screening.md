![Discord Membership Screening](/_resources/images/membership_screening.png)

:rotating_light: **NEVER share your IOTA Seed or Ledger Nano Recovery Phrase with anyone**. Not even if someone claims to be from the IOTA Foundation.   

**Disrespectful language and inappropriate emojis/photos are not tolerated**. Please be respectful to one another.

**This server is family friendly.** Anyone with an interest in IOTA can contribute. Please refrain from posting material that isn't family friendly.  

**Keep token price discussions in #speculation**. This server is about technology, not token prices. 

**Advertising is not allowed**. Explicit permission must be granted by someone from the IOTA Foundation. 

Please **keep discussions on-topic** for your current channel. Off-topic talk is allowed in the #casual channel. 

**Trolls are not welcome**. Please refrain from repeating the same argument or causing drama.  

**Do not ping IOTA Foundation members** unless they are already active in your channel. If you need to talk to someone, feel free to contact one of the Community managers (Antonio Nardella, Mark Schmidt or Dave de Fijter)  

:rotating_light: **Scammers will try to contact you via DM**. This is a public server and fake accounts may contact you. 

:rotating_light: **Don't trust IOTA Foundation, moderators, or community members that DM you.** Imposters are common. If you need to talk in DMs always initiate it yourself through the menu.  

:rotating_light: **Imposters use convincing, identical usernames and avatars**. If you don't trust something ask for help!

:rotating_light: **We NEVER ask you to transfer or exchange funds**. Don't trust anyone making a similar request and notify the moderators if this happens.
  
:rotating_light: **Don't use websites or external services to generate seeds**. Always use a safe method like Firefly (the official IOTA wallet).  

:rotating_light: **Only download software from official IOTA Foundation sources**. Don't trust direct links. Always find the software you need from https://www.iota.org/. For Firefly always use https://firefly.iota.org/.

By being in this server you comply with the **Discord Terms of Service**.  

If you have any issues with another user of this Discord please contact one of our moderators.
Public feedback on moderation decisions is not allowed, please DM the person in question if you have any questions about any action taken.
